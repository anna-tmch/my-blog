# MyBlog
💻 I created a pretty simple and clean [design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1170005409276331314) 
with the purpose to help my mentees to make the first steps toward Web Development and consolidate their knowledge of markup and CSS basics.<br>

It consists of:
- Header
- Breadcrumbs
- List of articles
- Pagination
- Footer

It covers some of the required topics at the start of learning HTML and CSS basics, e.g. understanding of site structure & semantic elements, layout, forms and buttons, hover/active states, etc.<br>


✌️ Feel free to try it out and leave your feedback!<br>

😉 *P.S: Don't cheat looking at finished files, try to implement a mockup from scratch and make a responsive version. I'm sure you can do it a better way! Good luck 🍀 <br>*
